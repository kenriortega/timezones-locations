# TimeZone App

## Description

The aims for this proyect are improve knowleges as a Frontend Developer. For make this solutions i taked ideas from two existing projects from [frontendmentor](http://worldtimeapi.org/), and the main idea was taken from [coderio challenge](https://github.com/goncy/coderio-challenge).In this week, i learn some web technologies e.g:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).For building the UI i used flexbox and grid css.For the api management i used axios as a javascript client and make request to the following API:
- [worldtimeapi.org](http://worldtimeapi.org/)
- [app.ipgeolocation.io](https://app.ipgeolocation.io)

In this solution the user need to search a timezone in the input box, and the web app show on a card simple information related to this search criteria, then when the user clicks on a card the app execute a request to the [api.ipgeolocation.io](https://api.ipgeolocation.io)
and save the latitude & logitude for this timezone and paint it in a map using [mapbox-gl](https://mapbox.com)
